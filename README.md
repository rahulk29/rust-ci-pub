# Rust CI (Public)

Configuration for setting up public Rust repos with [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just),
[`Ktra`](https://github.com/moriturus/ktra), [`GitLab`](https://about.gitlab.com/), and [Fly.io](https://fly.io/).
Heavily inspired by [fasterthanli.me](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/my-ideal-rust-workflow).
